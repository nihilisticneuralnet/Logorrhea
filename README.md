# Logorrhea


- training cost: 0 rs
- use only open surce models (hf) else eleven labs free
- voice tts should be emotion based
- user as a prompt


conversation law:
- total topic entropy must stay constant
- penalize repetition as an energy cost
- temeprature can change slowly



future
- debate between more than 2 people
- user can control variables (custom prompt, temp, small vs big params)
- Introduce an external “environment token” that changes slowly (like temperature or season)
- user can interrupt in bt (idk why might delte this)
- never eneding conversation util paused (memory handle)
